 * Location Query (LQ) Facility
 * 
 * A AbstractProximityDatabase-style wrapper for the LQ bin lattice system
 * 
 * <p>This utility is a spatial database which stores objects each of
 * which is associated with a 3d point (a location in a 3d space).
 * The points serve as the "search key" for the associated object.
 * It is intended to efficiently answer "sphere inclusion" queries,
 * also known as range queries: basically questions like:
     *
 * Which objects are within a radius R of the location L?
     *
 * In this context, "efficiently" means significantly faster than the
 * naive, brute force O(n) testing of all known points.  Additionally
 * it is assumed that the objects move along unpredictable paths, so
 * that extensive preprocessing (for example, constructing a Delaunay
 * triangulation of the point set) may not be practical.
     *
 * The implementation is a "bin lattice": a 3d rectangular array of
 * brick-shaped (rectangular parallelepipeds) regions of space.  Each
 * region is represented by a pointer to a (possibly empty) doubly-
 * linked list of objects.  All of these sub-bricks are the same
 * size.  All bricks are aligned with the global coordinate axes.
     *
 * Terminology used here: the region of space associated with a bin
 * is called a sub-brick.  The collection of all sub-bricks is called
 * the super-brick.  The super-brick should be specified to surround
 * the region of space in which (almost) all the key-points will
 * exist.  If key-points move outside the super-brick everything will
 * continue to work, but without the speed advantage provided by the
 * spatial subdivision.  For more details about how to specify the
 * super-brick's position, size and subdivisions see lqCreateDatabase
 * below.
     * 
 * Overview of usage: an application using this facility would first
 * create a database with lqCreateDatabase.  For each client object
 * the application wants to put in the database it creates a
 * lqClientProxy and initializes it with lqInitClientProxy.  When a
 * client object moves, the application calls lqUpdateForNewLocation.
 * To perform a query lqMapOverAllObjectsInLocality is passed an
 * application-supplied call-back function to be applied to all
 * client objects in the locality.  See lqCallBackFunction below for
 * more detail.  The lqFindNearestNeighborWithinRadius function can
 * be used to find a single nearest neighbor using the database.
     * 
 * Note that "locality query" is also known as neighborhood query,
 * neighborhood search, near neighbor search, and range query.  For
 * additional information on this and related topics 
 * http://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/ips.html
     *
 * For some description and illustrations of this database in use,
 * this paper: http://www.red3d.com/cwr/papers/2000/pip.html
